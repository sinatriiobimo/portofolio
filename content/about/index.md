Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Math-Natural Science in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Gunadarma University](https://gunadarma.ac.id/). Since then, I started developing Web and ML projects, and currently i still pursuing my Bachelors in Informatics Engineering (2018-2022).

Today, I'm currently working as a freelance software engineer responsible for several code development and testing. I have also been awarded as Encouragement Finalist in ASEAN-India Hackathon and Funding in [PKM Karsa Cipta 2021](https://simbelmawa.kemdikbud.go.id/portal/) by Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology.

Here is a list of the technologies that I work with!
